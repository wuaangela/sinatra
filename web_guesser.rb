# In this introductory level project, youâ€™ll use Sinatra to build a number guessing game.

# Goals
# It will:

# Generate a random number on startup
# Have a web page where you can enter a guess
# Tell you whether your guess wasâ€¦
# Way too high
# Too high
# Correct
# Too low
# Way too low

require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/reloader'

number = rand(100)

get '/' do
    erb :index, :locals => {:number => number}
end
